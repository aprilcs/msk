Every participant of the JupyterCon 2018 tutorial received a handful of candy. They then conducted an experiment exploring the impact of candy trading on their candy selection happiness:\n\n1. **Pre-trade**: Participants were asked to rate the happiness of their candy selection on a scale from 1-10 (trade 0). \n\n2. **Trade 1**: Participants were then allowed to trade with one participant and rate the happiness with their selection following the trade on a scale from 1-10 (trade 1). \n\n3. **Trade 2**: Participants were then allowed to trade with the whole group and rate their happiness with their final selection on a scale from 1-10 (trade 2)."
